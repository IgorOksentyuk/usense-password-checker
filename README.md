# Password Complexity Indicator
## Overview
The app categorizes passwords into three levels of strength:

__Easy:__ Passwords containing only letters, digits, or symbols fall into this category. The sections are displayed in red when the password is easy.

__Medium:__ Passwords that are a combination of letters and symbols, letters and digits, or digits and symbols fall into this category. For medium-strength passwords, the first two sections are colored yellow, while the last section remains gray.

__Strong:__ Passwords that contain a mix of letters, symbols, and numbers are considered strong. In this case, all three sections turn green.

The app uses a simple, yet effective color-coding system to convey password strength, helping users understand the security level of their passwords at a glance.
